Instructions

RiskProject works just like the original boardgame with some changes:
A turn is divided in 2 different stages:
  First add unassigned armies to a country. Click a country will add 1 to it.
  If you would like to attack a country:
    Click an attacking and defending country.
    (attacking being your own, and defending being an enemy country)
    Enter attacking and defending dice. (should be calculated using standard Risk rules)
    Click on the attack button.
    
  Players will receive cards they can exchange when they conquered 1 or more countries in their previes turn.
  Check the combinations section for all the different sections.
  Exchanging a card will add unassigned armies.
  
You can keep attacking during your turn, your actions are not limited.
